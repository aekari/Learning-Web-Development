		<p>The first step to creating a wesite is to create a folder. Once the folder has been created, create three folders in side of it. These three folders are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>JS</li>
			<li>Images</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After the folders have been created, open <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_">Sublime Text</a>. Once Sublime has opened:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Drag the website folder onto the Sublime icon/window</li>
				<li>Create a new file - File -> New </li>
				<li>Save the file in the root of the website folder as index.html</li>
			</ol>
